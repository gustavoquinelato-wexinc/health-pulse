h3. Scenario 1: Natural Language Query Processing
*Given* a user has access to the Pulse Platform with AI query interface
*When* they submit a natural language query like "Show me open PRs with high complexity"
*Then* the system should analyze query intent, process using appropriate method (semantic/structured/hybrid), and return relevant results within 3 seconds

h3. Scenario 2: Semantic Search Integration
*Given* the Qdrant vector database contains vectorized business data
*When* a user asks a semantic question like "Find similar issues to the authentication bug"
*Then* the system should perform vector similarity search and return semantically related items with confidence scores

h3. Scenario 3: Hybrid Query Processing
*Given* a complex query requiring both semantic and structured data
*When* a user asks "What are the trends in high-priority bugs over the last quarter?"
*Then* the system should combine semantic search with SQL queries and provide comprehensive analysis

h3. Scenario 4: Tenant Isolation
*Given* multiple tenants using the AI query interface
*When* any tenant submits queries
*Then* all results should be properly filtered by tenant_id with no cross-tenant data leakage

h3. Scenario 5: Error Handling and Validation
*Given* invalid or malformed queries
*When* users submit problematic requests
*Then* the system should provide helpful error messages and graceful degradation without system failures
