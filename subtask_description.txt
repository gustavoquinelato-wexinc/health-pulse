h3. Extraction Worker Implementation
# Create ExtractionWorker class extending BaseWorker
# Implement tier-based queue consumption for extraction_queue_{tier}
# Move Jira API extraction logic from job scheduler to extraction worker
# Add WebSocket progress updates during extraction phases

h3. Job Scheduler Updates
# Modify job scheduler to publish extraction messages instead of direct execution
# Update job start endpoints to return HTTP 202 Accepted immediately
# Implement job queuing with tenant tier routing
# Add job status tracking for queued → extracting → transforming flow

h3. Error Handling and Resilience
# Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed extractions
# Add dead letter queue configuration for permanently failed jobs
# Enhance logging for extraction worker debugging
# Add error notification system for failed jobs

h3. Database and Performance Optimization
# Optimize database queries to use replica for reads, primary for writes
# Implement connection pooling and quick connection closure
# Add database query performance monitoring
# Optimize WebSocket message handling for concurrent jobs

h3. Worker Management Integration
# Update WorkerManager to include extraction workers in tier-based pools
# Add extraction worker status monitoring and health checks
# Implement graceful worker shutdown and restart capabilities
# Add worker scaling configuration for extraction workers

h3. Testing and Validation
# Test concurrent job execution with multiple simultaneous jobs
# Validate non-blocking behavior with UI responsiveness tests
# Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
# Verify WebSocket progress updates work correctly across pipeline
