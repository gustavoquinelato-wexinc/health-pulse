h2. User Story
*As a* C-level executive and development team member using Pulse Platform
*I want* natural language query interface with semantic search capabilities
*so that* I can discover insights through conversational analytics instead of complex filters

h2. Background
The Pulse Platform has completed Phase 3-1 through 3-5 with clean 3-database architecture, multi-provider AI framework, and comprehensive vector storage. Phase 3-6 implements the natural language query interface that enables users to ask questions like "Show me high-risk PRs from last month" and receive intelligent responses combining semantic search with structured data.

h2. Technical Implementation
# Implement AIQueryProcessor class for natural language query processing
# Create Backend Service API endpoints: /api/v1/ai/query, /api/v1/ai/search, /api/v1/ai/capabilities
# Add query intent analysis with semantic, structured, and hybrid processing methods
# Integrate PostgreSQL data retrieval with proper SQL validation and tenant isolation
# Test complete AI query interface functionality

h2. Definition of Done
# AIQueryProcessor implemented with semantic, structured, and hybrid query processing
# Backend API endpoints operational with proper error handling and validation
# Query intent analysis working with HybridProviderManager integration
# PostgreSQL data retrieval integrated with tenant isolation and SQL validation
# All functionality tested and validated
