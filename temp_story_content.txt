TITLE: Non-Blocking ETL Job Execution for Concurrent Operations

DESCRIPTION:
h2. User Story
*As a* Platform Administrator managing ETL operations
*I want* ETL jobs to execute in the background without blocking the user interface
*So that* I can start multiple jobs concurrently and maintain full system responsiveness during data extraction operations

h2. Background
Currently, when ETL jobs are started, the entire frontend becomes unresponsive because the backend service performs synchronous Jira API extractions. This blocks users from starting additional jobs or performing other operations. The extraction process involves multiple paginated API calls that can take several minutes, during which the UI is completely frozen.

This story implements a queue-based extraction architecture where job requests are immediately queued for background processing, allowing the UI to remain responsive and enabling concurrent job execution.

h2. Definition of Done
# ETL job start endpoints return HTTP 202 Accepted immediately
# Extraction work is performed by dedicated background workers
# Multiple jobs can be started and run concurrently
# WebSocket progress updates work across the extraction → transform pipeline
# Error handling includes retry logic and dead letter queues
# Database operations are optimized using primary/replica pattern
# All existing ETL functionality remains intact

ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA:
h3. Scenario 1: Non-Blocking Job Start
*Given* I am on the ETL dashboard
*When* I click "Start Job" for a Jira extraction
*Then* I should receive an immediate response (< 1 second)
*And* the job should appear as "Queued" status
*And* the UI should remain fully responsive

h3. Scenario 2: Concurrent Job Execution
*Given* I have started one ETL job
*When* I start a second ETL job while the first is running
*Then* both jobs should execute concurrently
*And* I should see progress updates for both jobs
*And* neither job should block the other

h3. Scenario 3: Background Extraction Processing
*Given* an ETL job has been queued
*When* the extraction worker processes the job
*Then* the job status should update to "Extracting"
*And* I should receive real-time progress updates via WebSocket
*And* the extracted data should be queued for transformation

h3. Scenario 4: Error Handling and Recovery
*Given* an extraction job encounters an error
*When* the error occurs during API calls
*Then* the job should retry automatically with exponential backoff
*And* if retries fail, the job should be moved to a dead letter queue
*And* I should receive clear error notifications
