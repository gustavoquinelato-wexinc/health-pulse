h3. Scenario 1: Non-Blocking Job Start
*Given* I am on the ETL dashboard
*When* I click Start Job for a Jira extraction
*Then* I should receive an immediate response (< 1 second)
*And* the job should appear as Queued status
*And* the UI should remain fully responsive

h3. Scenario 2: Concurrent Job Execution
*Given* I have started one ETL job
*When* I start a second ETL job while the first is running
*Then* both jobs should execute concurrently
*And* I should see progress updates for both jobs
*And* neither job should block the other

h3. Scenario 3: Background Extraction Processing
*Given* an ETL job has been queued
*When* the extraction worker processes the job
*Then* the job status should update to Extracting
*And* I should receive real-time progress updates via WebSocket
*And* the extracted data should be queued for transformation

h3. Scenario 4: Error Handling and Recovery
*Given* an extraction job encounters an error
*When* the error occurs during API calls
*Then* the job should retry automatically with exponential backoff
*And* if retries fail, the job should be moved to a dead letter queue
*And* I should receive clear error notifications
