- **Score 2**: Small incremental improvements to existing features
- **Score 3**: Moderate enhancements that improve existing functionality without changing core behavior

### 🟡 Medium Innovation (4-7) - Typically H2 Initiatives

- **Score 4**: Significant enhancements that extend existing capabilities
- **Score 5**: New features that build upon existing product architecture
- **Score 6**: Adaptations of existing solutions to new markets or user segments

## ⚖️ Portfolio Balance Principles

### 📈 Optimal Distribution

- **70/20/10 Rule**: As a general guideline, organizations should allocate approximately 70% of their innovation resources to H1 initiatives, 20% to H2, and 10% to H3
- **Industry Variation**: The optimal distribution may vary by industry, company maturity, and market conditions

### 🎯 Key Considerations for Portfolio Balance

1. **Strategic Alignment**: All initiatives across horizons should align with the organization's strategic vision
2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure appropriate funding, talent, and time allocation across horizons
3. **Risk Management**: Balance risk across the portfolio to ensure sustainability
4. **Transition Planning**: Plan for successful initiatives to move from H3 to H2 to H1 over time
5. **Governance**: Establish different governance and success metrics for each horizon
